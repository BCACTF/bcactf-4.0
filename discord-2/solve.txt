Part 1: Turn off your internet connection. At least on the
Android version of Discord, this for some reason lets you
see the titles of all of the channels that someone with
no roles can see; this is why you can see them for a brief
second when joining (since the bot has to give you the
no_flag1_for_you role).

Part 2: You can't send messages and there are no slash
commands, but you can still interact with the bot using 
context menu (right click) interactions. You can discover
this either by fiddling around with the bot user or by 
researching the how the "[user] used [non-slash command]"
message works.
