  #### _We at BCACTF aspire to be unique._
  ###### ~me

  That's why we decided to use our own :sparkles:proprietary:sparkles: VCS for this year's
  challenges. It's a **new** and **more efficient**[^1] way to manage challenge versions, using
  The Blockchainâ„¢.

  If you're a cryptocurrency person though, this chain of blocks may disappoint you. But we
  here at BCACTF aspire to be unique, (see above,) and so we will do what we want and NOT
  what the users want.
  
  Either way, we have a bit of an embarrassing situation on our hands. We just built our new
  flag validator, and in the process of copying the repository to the production server, we
  ran into a _little_ issue... and lost one of our blocks.

  So would you uh... be willing to copy that over? I'm on vacation, and you seem to be a
  part of the new workplace family, so I'm sure you'd be happy to help us out, right?

  So would you be willing to copy over this block archive to the server? If you do that, I'd
  even give you ***:sparkles:exclusive:sparkles:*** access to the proprietary repository
  protocols.

  Just please don't tamper with it, okay? Actually, I don't trust you. Blockchains are
  immutable for security purposes.
  
  Now go get that second block in, okay?

  [^1]: Disclaimer: Almost definitely not true.

hints:
  - Can you make your own blocks?
  - How does the repository know what order to access the blocks in?
