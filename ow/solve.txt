All the background noise is audible through
both left and right channels, but the flag
audio is mostly coming through the left ear.
A sound wave will cancel with itself when
inverted (destructive interference), so
split the stereo audio into left and right
tracks and invert the right track. Then
playing both simultaneously (through both
tracks) will leave only the flag.

(In Audacity: Right click track on left > 
Split Stereo Track, move both tracks' 
position from 100% Left/100% Right to 
Centre, select right track and Effect > 
Special > Invert, play)
