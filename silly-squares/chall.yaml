  I found this marvelous painting of these squares over a red background.
  It is quite a piece of art.
  I don't know why I found them so funny, but I can't stop laughing at them.
  My teacher told me I have to find the flag or I fail. 
  However, the squares are so silly that I can't stop myself from laughing for long enough to find the flag.
  Can you please find them for me?
hints:
  - Have you tried taking a closer look at the squares?
  - Have you noticed how bright they look?
