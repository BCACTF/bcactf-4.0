- Use exiftool or something similar to extract the first 
  part of the flag in the author field: bcactf{i_h0P3_y0u_
- Use binwalk or examine the file with a hex editor to
  retrieve the embedded zip file, containing a text file
  with some filler text and then leaRN3d_s0m3th1nG_.
- Use zsteg or something similar to extract the final part
  of the flag encoded in the least significant bits:
  b9cvG8nf}.

Actually, zsteg basically solves the entire thing:
it shows the author field in the metadata, the LSB part,
and the zip archive data.
