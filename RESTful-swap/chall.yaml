  I made this server that lets you read my files, except my private ones. Anything with these file extensions is not allowed:
  'py', 'php', 'java', 'md', 'sh'. I'm working on adding the flag to the server, but you can still take a look around until then.
hints:
  - I love Vim. Vim is the best. I always have vim open.
  - Not every file will show up on the index page.
  - What other file types might be storing my data?
