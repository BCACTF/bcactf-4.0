  They said the flag was in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UYPl1kzuSTLJbN6kLkJR4aVFxo3nXUrKIiLLTQyOb8/), but it appears completely empty to me! Can you help me find it?
hints:
  - Make a copy of the spreadsheet and do stuff to it.
  - The first column tells you how to decode the second column.
