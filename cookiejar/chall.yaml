  I heards the Johnsons' cookie shop is amazing, but unfortunately the owner isn't around,
  Can you help me get the Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Cookies?
hints:
  - Where does the server get the information for order creation?
  - There are two separate important tasks - order creation and order acceptance.
