  I went to a blacksmith (sometimes called a smithy) the other day to get my copper sword fixed.
  When I came to pick it up, the smith told me he RSA-encoded it, and gave me a key to decrypt it with.
  Unfortunately, he accidentally gave me a public key instead of a private key, and now I can't access my sword. 
hints:
  - Could there be something wrong with the public key?
