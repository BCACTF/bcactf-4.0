  My good friend is an assiduous student and has been diligently taking notes [here](https://github.com/Studious-Notetaker/REPO-OF-EPICNESS).
  I don't see his notes! Do you?
hints:
  - GitHub won't be useful here. Clone the repository using git and have a look around.
  - Where in that repository might he be using git to hide his notes?
  - My friend tells me that the commit log won't show his secrets until a special command is run to fetch them.
