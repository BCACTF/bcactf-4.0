Some investigation will show that the weird 3D model is a
solid of revolution (made in LibreOffice with Convert > To
3D Rotation Object). It is tedious but possible to get the
characters of the flag one at a time by investigating each
part of it, but extracting the contents.xml file (since a
.odp is just a zip) gives you the SVG paths for each
character.
