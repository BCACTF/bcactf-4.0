  I'm storing some secret information on my website, but I realized I need an anti-captcha service.
  I don't want any humans to gain these insights before the AI revolution, so I've drafted a system that only robots could beat.
  I don't think any humans could type *this* fast!
hints:
  - Have you tried typing faster?
  - You should read faster too.
  - Don't mess up.
